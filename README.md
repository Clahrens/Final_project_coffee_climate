# Final_project_coffee_climate
This is the final project of the Data Science and Statistics course in the Sustainable Managament and Technology Master (SMT) at EPFL. The research goal is to understand the impact of climate change and its extreme events on the coffee production. This study will use a difference in difference ceapproach, in order to proove causality between weather impacts and regional coffee production. To do so, we focus on the regional coffee production in Brazil, including 12 main coffee regions. This country was chosen, due to its importance in the coffee industry, with contributing over 35% to the global production.
